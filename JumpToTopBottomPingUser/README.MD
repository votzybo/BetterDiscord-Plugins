### 📌 Description

`JumpToTopBottomPingUser` is a sleek navigation widget for Discord chat that sits to the right of the upload button. It expands on hover and gives you instant access to:

- 🔝 **Jump to Top** of the current chat using the exact internal Discord routing.
- 🎯 **Jump to Present** using the native "Jump to Present" button, or a scroll fallback if it's unavailable.
- 🧠 **Jump to Most Recent Mention** (a recent ping directed at you).
- 👤 **Jump to Most Recent Own Message** for fast self-referencing.

Toast notifications appear centered above the chat to confirm actions and improve user feedback.
